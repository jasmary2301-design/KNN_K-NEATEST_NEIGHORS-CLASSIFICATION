# KNN_K-NEATEST_NEIGHORS-CLASSIFICATION
KNN is a distance- based supervised learning using scaling techniques such as StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler. The model is trained using a train-test split and evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification for iris  dataset.

The project implement the K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) algorithm to classify flower sprcies using the iris dataset.The dataset consists of four features_sepal length,sepal width,petal length,and petal width-usedto perdict the species ofof an iris flower:Setosa,Versicolor,or Viriginica.
